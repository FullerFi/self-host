Install Docker Compose (v2) on Ubuntu
This method ensures you get the latest version and integrates it as a Docker plugin.

1. Install Docker and ensure it's running:
  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
  
# Verify Docker is working:
  
docker --version

2. Download and Install Docker Compose v2 as a plugin:

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins
sudo curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

3. Give Execute Permissions:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose

4. Verify the Installation:

Run the following to check if Docker Compose is installed correctly:

docker compose version
# (Note: No hyphen in docker compose because v2 is now a Docker plugin.)


(Alternative) Install via APT Package
If you prefer using APT (though it might not always have the latest version):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-compose-plugin
  
Verify installation:

docker compose version
