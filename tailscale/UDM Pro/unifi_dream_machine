Install (or Reinstall) Tailscale on UDM Pro
The UDM Pro runs a custom Linux environment, so we need to install Tailscale differently.

Option A: Install Tailscale via Script (Recommended)
Run this command:
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
This will download and install the latest version.

Option B: Manually Install the .deb Package
If the script doesn’t work, manually download and install it:
curl -LO https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/tailscale_1.80.2_amd64.deb
dpkg -i tailscale_1.80.2_amd64.deb

3. Enable and Start Tailscale
Once installed, start the service:
tailscaled
tailscale up
(You may need to authenticate using a URL it provides.)

4. Verify the Installation
tailscale version
tailscale status

5. Ensure Tailscale Persists After Reboot (if needed)
By default, the UDM Pro does not persist custom software after reboot. If you want Tailscale to stay installed, you'll need to set up udm-boot.


How to Update Tailscale:

1. SSH into Your UDM Pro
Open a terminal and connect to your UDM Pro:
ssh root@<UDM-IP>
(Replace <UDM-IP> with your actual UDM Pro IP.)

2. Stop the Running Tailscale Service
tailscale logout
If you installed Tailscale via udm-boot, you may need to stop the service manually:

systemctl stop tailscaled

3. Download and Install the Latest Tailscale
Run the following command to get the latest version:
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
This script will automatically install the latest version.

4. Restart the Tailscale Service
systemctl restart tailscaled
If you’re using udm-boot for persistence, you may need to reload it:

5. Verify the Update
tailscale version
