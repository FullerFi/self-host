Download the Correct Tailscale Package
Once you know your DSM version, go to:
https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#spks

Look for the correct .spk package for DSM6 or DSM7 (x86_64) and copy the download link.

To find your DSM version, run this command within your NAS:
cat /etc.defaults/VERSION

Look for the 'majorversion' field:
If it says 6 → You need the DSM6 package.
If it says 7 → You need the DSM7 package.

1. Stop the Tailscale Package
sudo synopkg stop Tailscale

3. Install the New Version
sudo synopkg install tailscale-x86_64-1.80.0-700080000-dsm7.spk

5. Start Tailscale Again
sudo synopkg start Tailscale

7. Verify the Update
tailscale version
