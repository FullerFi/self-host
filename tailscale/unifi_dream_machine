Install (or Reinstall) Tailscale on UDM Pro
The UDM Pro runs a custom Linux environment, so we need to install Tailscale differently.

Option A: Install Tailscale via Script (Recommended)
Run this command:
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
This will download and install the latest version.

Option B: Manually Install the .deb Package
If the script doesnâ€™t work, manually download and install it:
curl -LO https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/tailscale_1.80.2_amd64.deb
dpkg -i tailscale_1.80.2_amd64.deb

3. Enable and Start Tailscale
Once installed, start the service:
tailscaled
tailscale up
(You may need to authenticate using a URL it provides.)

4. Verify the Installation
tailscale version
tailscale status

5. Ensure Tailscale Persists After Reboot (if needed)
By default, the UDM Pro does not persist custom software after reboot. If you want Tailscale to stay installed, you'll need to set up udm-boot.
